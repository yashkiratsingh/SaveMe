 In today’s competitive world, there is a grieve problem of depression especially among the younger generation. The never ending competition is prevalent in every section of working society. School students are under pressure of performing good n boards or to clear competitve exams. Among college too the situation is more or less the same. Professionals working in MNC’s are always in a hurry to meet the deadlines and are worried for their jobs and appraisals. This pressure along with increasing crime and violation of human rights by some individuals has resulted in an increasing Rate of deteriorating mental health which in many cases results in suicides too.
             Understanding this problem, we Three Musketeers want to provide an effective solution to the society. We aim to bridge the gap between the affected and the healers of this problem. ‘SaveMe’ aims to redress the queries of those suffering by providing anonymous help from professionals like psychologists, lawyers and doctors etc. 
             Our website ‘SaveME’ has different portals for users and advisors. Users can either search answer to their problem from existing solution to other answers or they can ask their own question from specialised problem. E.g.: A worker who is exploited by his/her employer with overwork and less salary can seek advice from a lawyer.
